Winner of the medical application challenge at CBHACK organised by Cambridge Blockchain society (https://cambridgeblockchain.org/index.html#activities) sponsored by todaq finance (https://www.todaqfinance.com/).

## Context

The premise of the challenge is to enable patients in Sub-sahara context to have easy access to their medical record electronically while maintaining total control of their record with privacy control through a blockchain network where only the certified doctors have access.

### Solution proposed here

A web app run in Python that interactively retrieves and sends information to TODAQ API end points incorporating both patient view and doctor view of the app.
